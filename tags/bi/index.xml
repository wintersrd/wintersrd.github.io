      <description>&lt;p&gt;Solution providers (See Gartner BI Quadrant for full vendor overview):
    - Traditional BI: Microsoft, Cognos, Microstrategy
    - Visual Exploration: Tableau, Qlik Sense, Tibco Spotfire
    - Deep data analysis: Looker
    - Roll your own: Shiny, D3, Python&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem space that most organizations are facing leans towards Visual Exploration above traditional BI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional BI flow:
    - ETL-&amp;gt;Pre-aggregate to cubes-&amp;gt;Present (mostly) static reports
A more modern approach:
    -ELT-&amp;gt;Direct query against cleaned event tables
    Benefits:
        - (Near) real time flow
        - Allows rapid iteration against the data / data definitions
        - Rower maintenance (fewer cubes)
        - Deep analysis on reporting data
    Costs:
        - Storage must be highly performant due to lack of aggregations
        - Can be more complex for end users due to higher dimensionality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges BI faces today:
    - Rapidly changing schemas in unstructured/semi-structured data
    - Merging of small and big data for your reporting; most platforms work well for one or the other
    - Achieving scalability of your BI team as more and more employees consume data in a high interactivity manner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergent paradigms driving design consideration:
    - Self-service is a must due to employee expectations
    - Mobile is rapidly becoming significant
    - Cycle time for reporting is reducing due to success in agile development
    - Analytics becoming more important relative to reporting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common solutions to support these paradigms:
    - Structured/cleaned event bus backing reporting
    - Real time aggregations using (for example) Apache Spark
    - Lambda architecture data models to support reporting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best practices:
    - Isolate financial big data reporting and operational
    - &amp;lt;5 seconds for report to load
    - Put data management in your BI team&amp;rsquo;s hands, report development embedded in your ops teams&lt;/p&gt;
