This I had the privilege to sit in on a conference discussing [neuromarketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromarketing): the roles of cognitive psychology, intrinsic motivation/intent, and emotional response analysis in designing products and experiences.
It's an interesting contrast from the usual approaches like A/B testing because rather than simply evaluating the success metrics, it attempts to explain _why_ consumers react the way they do to changes in experience, measured by EEGs and eye tracking. Presenters included Transavia, ING, Blue Mango, Telfort, and Incentro. Some key takeaways:

**1. Assumptions of customer preference should always be tested:** Blue Mango shared the results of a test based on the idea that customers would be more preferential towards a brand they already owned; for example, Samsung customers would respond stronger to a Samsung ad than an LG one. In only case (Apple) did they find this to be the case.

**2. Effective personalization should be based on intrinsic needs:** Incentro broke down personalization into three theories of why individuals are influenced:

- _Persuasive:_ The information presented is convincing that this the right choice

- _Motivation level:_ The effort required to take the action is low relative to my intrinsic motivation (why not?)

- _Proximity:_ The offer is presentated at a time/place where it aligns to a consumer's intrinsic needs
