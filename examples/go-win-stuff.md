No, not contests, <a href="http://golang.org/" target="_blank">golang</a> (the programming language), and Win as in Windows.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Quick background - Recently I started writing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD" target="_blank">MUD</a> in Go for the purposes of learning Go, and writing something that is non-trivial to code. &nbsp;MUDs are particularly suited to Go, since they are entirely server based, are text-based, and are highly concurrent and parallel problems (which is to say, you have a whole bunch of people doing stuff all at the same time on the server).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, after getting a pretty good prototype of the MUD up and running (which was quite fun), I started thinking about using Go for some scripty things that I want to do at work. There's a bit of a hitch, though... the docs on working in Windows are not very good. &nbsp;In fact, if you look at golang.org, they're actually non-existent. &nbsp;This is because the syscall package changes based on what OS you're running on, and (not surprisingly) Google's public golang site is not running on Windows.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, anyway, a couple notes here on Windowy things that you (I) might want to do with Go:</div><div><br /></div><div>Open the default browser with a given URL:</div><br /><pre class="brush: go; gutter: false;tab-size: 4;">import (<br />    "syscall/exec"<br />) <br /><br />func OpenBrowser(url string) {<br />    exec.Command("rundll32", "url.dll", "FileProtocolHandler", url)<br />}<br /></pre>Example of a wrapper for syscall's Windows Registry functions:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: go; gutter: false;tab-size: 4;">import (<br />    "syscall"<br />)<br /><br />func ReadRegString(hive syscall.Handle, subKeyPath, valueName string) (value string, err error) {<br />    var h syscall.Handle<br />    err = syscall.RegOpenKeyEx(hive, syscall.StringToUTF16Ptr(subKeyPath), 0, syscall.KEY_READ, &amp;h)<br />    if err != nil {<br />        return<br />     }<br />     defer syscall.RegCloseKey(h)<br /><br />    var typ uint32<br />    var bufSize uint32<br /><br />    err = syscall.RegQueryValueEx(<br />              hKey,<br />              syscall.StringToUTF16Ptr(valueName),<br />              nil,<br />              &amp;typ,<br />              nil,<br />              &amp;bufSize)<br />    if err != nil {<br />        return<br />    }<br /><br />    data := make([]uint16, bufSize/2+1)<br /><br />    err = syscall.RegQueryValueEx(<br />              hKey,<br />              syscall.StringToUTF16Ptr(valueName),<br />              nil,<br />              &amp;typ,<br />              (*byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;data[0])),<br />              &amp;bufSize)<br />    if err != nil {<br />        return<br />    }<br /><br />    return syscall.UTF16ToString(data), nil<br />}<br /></pre>
