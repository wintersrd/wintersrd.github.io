Some of my coworkers are coming up to speed on Go, so I figured I'd write a little post on how to get going with Go. The intended audience is people who are familiar with C# and Java, since that's what my coworkers are familiar with. If that's not your background, some of this may not entirely make sense.<br /><br /><b>What is Go?</b><br />Go is a statically typed, compiled language with C-like syntax. It compiles into native executables, so you don't need to have any frameworks installed on a machine you're running it on.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
