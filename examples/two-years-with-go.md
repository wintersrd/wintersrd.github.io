Two and a half years ago, I heard about the 1.0 release of Go.  My first thought was "No exceptions?  Pass."  Heh, how we live and learn.

Approximately two years ago, I read about Go again, and decided to try it out. Coming from a C++ and C# background, the C-like syntax immediately felt familiar.  Running through the Go tour and reading the language spec (yes, I actually did that), it became clear how small the language is, and how easy it is to wrap your head around it.... like the whole thing, not just a common subset.
